## Abstract

## Keywords
Linked Data; Peer-to-Peer Systems; Data Ownership; Distributed Systems; Annotation

## Introduction
Narrative: You want to annotate digital artifacts? Linked Data has you covered. But where to store it? There is the distinction between institutional and personal data. Why store personal data in the cloud while not maintaining cryptographic ownership? Also, contemporary technology allows for your real-time collaboration.

Who is my audience?:
- People not familiar with this matter
- DH students, PhD students, other researchers of the DH domain

Data ownership. 

In recent years, Digital Humanities' collaborative nature has resulted in digitally-native, interdisciplinary research workflows among open data repositories. Tasks shared across disciplines, such as creating corpora, annotating manuscripts, and natural language processing, have arguably never been more accessible. Backed by open standards and protocols, platforms for managing these workflows soon emerged and achieve interoperable data exchange with their scholarly users.

However, those platforms raise data ownership and privacy concerns, practically being data silos storing data on one’s behalf. Eliminating the middlemen between researchers, local-first software connected by peer-to-peer (P2P) networks could embrace digital ownership, while further supporting discovery, interoperability, transparency, and privacy via cryptographic methods and open communication protocols.
